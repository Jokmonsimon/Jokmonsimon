## Snr. Software Engineer, Researcher & Founder at Yearn AI

Hello, I am Ojok Simon Peter from Gulu, Uganda. Am passionate about Machine Learning and AI technologies. Am a Software Engineer, Researcher & Founder at Yearn AI. Yearn AI is a small company I founded on 23 September 2021 with a mission of accelerating the development of artificial intelligence in Africa by providing a data-centric, end-to-end solution to manage the entire Machine Learning Lifecycle. I love “Doing Hard Things” to solve complex problems in this world. Therefore, I am constantly learning! And Failure is my tallest ladder to success! Skillswise, I am a Python and JavaScript Developer specializing in Machine Learning and AI technologies. I am looking for a company where I can Learn, Develop and Apply my knowledge.

These are my favorite languages i use.

### Mindset Change for Young Africans
I initiated the first project Mindset Change for Young Africans with vision to ignite the minds of young Africans to be innovative. The project ran from 1 to 31 December 2021. After the evaluation, the project proved to the back-bone of igniting innovative ideas to over hundreds of young Africans who benefited from the project. Here are the project videos.
