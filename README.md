## Projects
### Mindset Change for Young Africans
I initiated the first project Mindset Change for Young Africans with vision to ignite the minds of young Africans to be innovative. The project ran from 1 to 31 December 2021. After the evaluation, the project proved to the back-bone of igniting innovative ideas to over hundreds of young Africcans who benefited from the project. Here are the project videos.
